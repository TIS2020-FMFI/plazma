<i><h2>An Intelligent Plotter Emulator for HP-GL/2-Compatible Instruments</h2></i>
<P>
<br>
<P>
7470.EXE is a Win32-based emulator for the HP 7470A plotter.  It will acquire an HP-GL/2 plot and render it
in a window.  The plot can then be printed, viewed as an overlay with other plots, or saved in several different graphics file formats as well as its original HP-GL/2
format.
<P>
With the help of 7470.EXE, you can capture screenshots from GPIB-based test equipment 
such as digital oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, logic analyzers, and more.  7470.EXE can
even recognize certain instrument models and and request plots from them without user access to their
front-panel controls.
<P>
7470.EXE is part of the <a href="./readme.htm">KE5FX GPIB Toolkit</a>.  The latest version of the Toolkit is downloadable <a href="http://www.thegleam.com/ke5fx/gpib/setup.exe">here</a>.
<br clear=all>
<P>
<P class="subhead">Running 7470</P>
<P>
Depending on the options you selected during installation, you can run 7470.EXE from the Start menu, by clicking on its desktop shortcut, or by
using its Quick Launch icon on the taskbar.  You can also run 7470.EXE from a DOS-box 
command line or Windows Start->Run... command, optionally
specifying a GPIB address from which to acquire host-requested plots (see below), or the names of one or more existing HP-GL/2 data files.  Use quotes around filenames that contain 
spaces - for example, 
<P>

<pre>
      7470 "IMD test.plt"            ... Display "IMD test.plt" by itself
      7470 before.plt after.plt      ... Overlay before.plt and after.plt
      7470 (no command-line options) ... Display all plots in the current directory
</pre>
<P>
You can acquire your own HP-GL/2 .PLT files via the options on the Acquire menu, if your PC has a National Instruments-compatible GPIB interface or a Prologix GPIB-USB/GPIB-ETHERNET adapter.  <b>It's important
to understand that there are two ways to do this in 7470.EXE.</b>  Unlike other plotter emulators, 7470.EXE supports both <i>host-requested</i> and <i>device-initiated</i> plotting operations.  
<P>
<b>Host-Requested Plots</b>
<P>
A few instruments, currently limited to the following models, support "host-requested" plotting in 7470.EXE.   
<ul>
<li>Tektronix TDS 5/6/7xx-series oscilloscopes
<li>Tektronix 490P/2750P-series spectrum analyzers (including 492P and 496P)
<li>Tektronix 2710-series spectrum analyzers
<li>Tektronix 2782/2784 spectrum analyzers
<li>HP 3561A dynamic signal analyzers
<li>HP 3585A/B spectrum analyzers (see notes below)
<li>HP 8566A/8567A/8568A spectrum analyzers (see notes below)
<li>HP 8566B/8567B/8568B spectrum analyzers
<li>HP 8560A/B/E and 8590-series portable spectrum analyzers
<li>HP 54100- and 54200-series digital oscilloscopes
<li>Tektronix 2430A, 2432/2432A, and 2440/2440A digital oscilloscopes
<li>Tektronix SCD-series transient digitizers (ROM version 1.5 or later)
<li>Various SCPI-compatible spectrum analyzers (tested on Rohde & Schwarz FSP)
</ul>
If your instrument appears in this list, then you can use the Acquire menu to ask it to send an HP-GL/2 plot to 7470.EXE 
without the need for any interaction with the instrument's front-panel controls. 
Given a sufficiently-long GPIB cable, you don't even need to be in the same room as the instrument. This mode
of operation is also handy for another reason: as 7470.EXE communicates with the instrument
to request the plot, it can also turn on graticule illumination, enable the desired display elements, select appropriate pen
colors, and execute other plotter-setup tasks that the user would otherwise need to perform manually.
<P>
Normally, you'll issue host-initiated plot requests by selecting one of the "Request plot from supported device at address n" options
on the Acquire menu.  Instrument shortcut entries (see below) can also be selected.  Note that earlier Prologix adapters, and those with their DIP switches set to Device mode, can't support host-requested plots at all.
<P>
Most instruments that support host-requested plots may be addressed directly on the 7470.EXE command line, just like a .PLT filename:

<pre>	7470 3
</pre>

The above example is suitable for inclusion in a Windows desktop shortcut. When clicked, the shortcut will launch 7470.EXE, which will then immediately request 
a plot from the supported instrument at GPIB address 3. This feature allows you to capture screenshots with a single mouse click on the host PC.
<P>
<b>Host-Requested Plots via Instrument Menu Shortcuts</b>
<P>
Beginning with the 1.80 release of 7470.EXE, you can also add strings of the form

<pre>	instrument_0         Tektronix 2430A at GPIB address 4\tF2
</pre>
to the 7470.INI file in the 7470.EXE program directory.  The file contains several entries that illustrate how
this is done.  (See below for more information on 7470.INI.)  If any of these entries are present (and not 
commented out with a leading semicolon), the Acquire menu will include a list of the instrument 
name/address specification strings and allow you to select one with the mouse, or, alternatively, by 
pressing a function key.
<P>
<b>Important notes for users of HP 8566A-8568A, HP 3585A/B, and SCPI-compatible spectrum analyzers and HP 8510- and 87xx-series VNAs</b>
<P>
Some instruments can't be automatically identified and addressed by 7470.EXE, and many also don't support 
HP-GL/2 plotting at all.  Fortunately, 7470.EXE can still work with certain instrument models that are 
incompatible with other plotters and emulators.  
<P>
<blockquote>
<P>
<i>HP 8566A, HP 8567A, and HP 8568A spectrum analyzers</i><P>
In order to tell 7470.EXE to access one of these 
instruments, at least one instrument menu shortcut must contain the string "8566A", "8567A", or "8568A".
When a shortcut key corresponding to an HP 8566A-8568A spectrum analyzer is pressed, 
7470.EXE will request raw annotation, state, and trace data from the analyzer and generate its own HP-GL/2 .PLT 
file image based on it.  This HP-GL/2 image may then be saved, rendered, and printed just like
any other .PLT file.   A typical menu shortcut for an HP 8566A-8568A spectrum analyzer looks like this:
<pre>	instrument_0         HP 8566A / 8567A / 8568A (via HP-GL/2 emulation) at GPIB address 18\tF8
</pre>
<P>
The HP-GL/2 synthesis process for the HP 8566A-8568A analyzers takes place in less than a second, including the data acquisition itself.  
It's actually a great way to access the later HP 8566B-8568B models as well; not only are 7470.EXE's synthesized HP-GL/2 plots much faster to acquire, 
but certain features such as markers look much better than they do in the B-series analyzers' own plots.  Note, 
however, that a few display features such as the 'C' trace and hardware diagnostic/error messages will not appear in a 
synthesized plot.
<P>
<i>HP 3585A/B spectrum analyzers</i><P>
In order to tell 7470.EXE to access one of these 
instruments, at least one instrument menu shortcut must contain the string "3585".
When a shortcut key corresponding to an HP 3585A/B spectrum analyzer is pressed, an HP-GL/2 plot will be 
synthesized from raw instrument data, as with the HP 8566A-8568A support process described above.  A typical menu shortcut for an HP 3585A/B spectrum analyzer looks like this:
<pre>	instrument_0         HP 3585A/B (via HP-GL/2 emulation) at GPIB address 11\tF3
</pre>
<P>
<i>HP 87xx- and 8510-series vector network analyzers</i><P>
In order to tell 7470.EXE to access one of these 
instruments, at least one instrument menu shortcut must contain the string "8510", "8753", or "8702".
When a shortcut key corresponding to one of these VNAs is pressed, a conventional HP-GL/2 plot will be 
fetched and rendered.  A typical menu shortcut looks like this:
<pre>instrument_6         HP 8510 or 8753 series at GPIB address 16\tF9
</pre>
<P>
<i>SCPI-compatible spectrum analyzers</i><P>
Some SCPI-compatible models supported by SSM.EXE and SATRACE.EXE can be addressed by 7470.EXE by placing the string "SCPI" in an
instrument menu shortcut.  The default 7470.INI file contains an instrument shortcut associating the F11 key with a SCPI instrument 
at address 20:
<pre>instrument_7         Supported SCPI-compatible spectrum analyzer at GPIB address 20\tF11 
</pre>
In principle most of the SCPI instruments supported by SSM should work with this option, but currently only the
Rohde & Schwarz FSP has been tested.
</blockquote>
<P>
Again, the normal host- or device-initiated plot menu options will <b>not</b> work with these instruments. 
<P>
Beginning in version 1.92, a few instrument-menu shortcuts are included by default in 7470.INI.  If your
8566A-8568A analyzer's GPIB address is 18, you don't have to modify 7470.INI at all -- just hit F8!  Likewise,
F9 will acquire a plot from an 8510-series network analyzer by default.
<P>
<b>Device-Initiated Plots</b>
<P>
If your instrument doesn't appear in the list above, that means it isn't 
directly supported by 7470.EXE, and won't work with the Acquire->Request 
functions, instrument menu shortcuts, or the command-line GPIB address feature. However, chances are 
good that you can still obtain plots from it by activating its front-panel "Plot" 
button while 7470.EXE is in the "Wait for device-initiated plot" mode. 
This mode may be selected from the Acquire menu, or by pressing the
lower-case 'w' key.

<P>
<P class="subhead">GPIB Instrument and Interface Configuration Notes</P>
<P>
Host-requested plotting requires 7470.EXE to carry on a two-way GPIB conversation with the instrument, so you'll need to configure your instrument for Talk/Listen mode (as opposed to
Talk-Only or System Controller mode) for use with this feature.  This typically involves changing a system-level menu option or DIP switch.  
All National Instruments GPIB adapters support host-requested plotting, but only versions 3.1 and later of the Prologix GPIB-USB adapter 
can provide the necessary GPIB controller functionality.  All Prologix GPIB-ETHERNET adapter versions are compatible.  (For more information on the Prologix adapters, you can contact Prologix <a href="http://www.prologix.biz">here</a>.)
<P>
<P>
Device-initiated plotting usually requires the instrument to be configured for Talk-Only mode.  When their front-panel PLOT buttons are pressed, some 
instruments, such as the HP analyzers, expect the <i>plotter</i> to be addressable at a specific GPIB address, usually 5.  The 
emulated plotter address is normally controlled by 7470.EXE's GPIB menu, unless an older Prologix adapter with DIP switches
is in use.  Certain instruments expect to be the only addressable device on the bus when their PLOT buttons are pressed, requiring selection 
of the "Listen only" option in 7470.EXE's GPIB menu.  
<P>
As you can imagine, experimentation is sometimes needed to 
find the right combination of device and host settings that will allow 7470.EXE to work with a particular instrument.  Some notes on specific instruments appear below.
<ul>
<li><b>Tektronix 490P and 2750P spectrum analyzers</b>
<ul>
<li>Device-initiated plots with 494P and later models: Must be set to Talk-Only mode via DIP switch in rear.  This may cause problems if other devices are on the GPIB bus.  7470 GPIB setting must be "No assigned plotter address (listen only)."  Plot with front-panel PLOT button (typically Blue Shift-PLOT).
<li>Host-requested plots (recommended for all 49x models, and required for 492P/496P): Both Talk-Only and Listen-Only switches should be off (0).  LF-or-EOI switch does not matter for use with 7470.EXE, but should be set to on (1) for use with SSM.EXE and PN.EXE utilities.  (Tip: if you set address 3, you can use the F4 keyboard shortcut that's predefined in 7470.INI.)
<li>DIP switches on these instruments are extremely prone to age-related failures.  <i>Verbum sat sapienti est.</i>
</ul>
<li><b>Tektronix 2782 and 2784 spectrum analyzers</b>
<ul>
<li>Device-initiated plots: GPIB board must be connected to dedicated plotter output port on rear panel.  7470 GPIB setting must be configured to listen on address 5.  
(Note that the analyzer cannot be controlled via this port, so many GPIB Toolkit users will want to use host-requested plots instead.
These work by synthesizing an HP-GL/2 plot from raw instrument data obtained from the GPIB control port.)
<li>Host-requested plots: This feature uses the HP-GL/2 synthesis code developed for the HP 8566A-8568A analyzers.  In the current implementation, markers and 
traces other than NORMAL and A will not be visible in plots requested from a 2782/2784.
</ul>
<li><b>Tektronix 2430A / 2432 / 2440 DSOs</b>
<ul>
<li>Device-initiated plots: DSO must be set to "Plotter" device mode.  7470 GPIB setting must be "No assigned plotter address (listen only)."  
<li>Host-requested plots (recommended): DSO must be set to T/L device mode.  7470 GPIB setting does not matter.
<li>7470.EXE will NOT work with the earlier 2430 model, since it does not support GPIB plotting at all.
</ul>
<li><b>Tektronix SCD-series transient waveform digitizers</b>
<ul>
<li>Device-initiated plots: Issued automatically after triggered acquisition is complete
<li>Host-requested plots: Available on ROM versions 1.5 and later; earlier versions must use device-initiated plotting
</ul>
<li><b>HP 8566B, 8567B, and 8568B spectrum analyzers</b>
<ul>
<li>Device-initiated plots: 7470 must be configured via the GPIB menu to listen at address 5.  
<li>Press "Lower Left" button on front panel for device-initiated plotting.
<li>Host-requested plots are also possible with these analyzers.  For faster plotting, though, try the 8566A/8567A/8568A-series menu shortcut (F8) technique described above!
<li>Other HP 8560- and 8590-series spectrum analyzers are reported as working like HP 8566B. Host-requested plots may work on these; if not, device-initiated plots should be possible.
</ul>
<li><b>HP 8566A, 8567A, and 8568A spectrum analyzers</b>
<ul>
<li>These do not support HP-GL/2 plots at all, either device-initiated or host-requested.  See notes above on how to work around this limitation.

Keep in mind that some instruments need to be set to Talk-Only mode to support device-initiated plots. However, some of those instruments, when 
set to Talk-Only mode, may prevent other instruments on the GPIB bus from communicating with 7470.EXE (or anything else). Users of multiple 
GPIB instruments may need to experiment to find a configuration that allows all of the instruments to work properly with each other.
<P>
Also, if you have more than two or three
powered-down instruments on the GPIB bus, keep in mind that they'll load the bus, possibly preventing successful communication with the instrument(s) that are turned on.  When 
attempting to use 7470.EXE with a new instrument for the first time, it's best to use a simple direct connection between the instrument and the host PC's GPIB adapter.
<P>
 I'm always interested in hearing from users of other instruments so they may be added to 
the list above. Please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:john@miles.io">john@miles.io</a> with any bug reports or success stories.

<P class="subhead">CONNECT.INI</P>
<P>
Your PC's local user data directory should contain a file called CONNECT.INI, which tells the GPIB Toolkit how to
take advantage of various GPIB connectivity options.  These include direct RS-232 or TCP/IP links, as well as 
the Prologix GPIB-USB and GPIB-ETHERNET adapters.
<P>If you have a Prologix adapter, you can review the comments in CONNECT.INI 
to learn how to configure 7470 and the other GPIB Toolkit applications to use it, 
or you can simply select your adapter in the GPIB configurator application (PROLOGIX.EXE)
and press "Update CONNECT.INI" to automate the configuration process.
<P>
If the COM port specification in CONNECT.INI is commented out with a 
leading semicolon -- or if CONNECT.INI is missing entirely -- all GPIB Toolkit applications will attempt to 
communicate with the GPIB0 device via the National Instruments NI488.2 programming interface instead.  This is the default behavior.
<P>
<b>Note that some versions of Windows hide .INI file suffixes by default.</b>  In Windows 2000 and XP, for instance, CONNECT.INI may appear simply as "CONNECT," with the type "Configuration Settings."  To
turn off this behavior, go to the Tools->Folder Options->View tab in any Explorer window and deselect the "Hide file extensions for known file types" option.  The exact location of CONNECT.INI may vary from one
Windows installation to the next.  It's often easier to select the "Edit CONNECT.INI" button in the GPIB configurator application than to try to locate the file yourself.

<P class="subhead">Release Notes</P>
<P>
Release 0.91 of 31-Oct-01
<ul>
<li>Some formatting improvements and assorted updates, but still an alpha release!
</ul>
Release 0.92 of 22-Jan-02
<ul>
<li>Takes multiple files or GPIB addresses to plot, overlay-style
<li>Runs at 800x600 by default
<li>Lets you print the current plot on any Windows-compatible printer
by hitting 'p' (inkjets are great for this!) 
<li>This release also includes source for my GPIBLIB wrapper for National 
Instruments NI488 drivers.
</ul>
Release 0.93 of 28-Jan-02
<ul>
<li>Wildcards can now be used on the command line (e.g., 7470 ..\myfiles\*.plt)
<li>If wildcards are used, all matching files will be 
displayed one at a time. Use the + and - keys to navigate 
the file list. You may also run 7470 by itself to display 
all .PLT, .HPG, .HGL, and .PGL files in the current 
directory.
<li>Hit 's' to save the current plot as a 16-bit .TGA file. Many
photo editors, including Microsoft's, will allow you to 
manipulate these files and convert them to other common formats
such as .GIF, .BMP, or .JPG.
</ul>
Release 0.94 of 03-Feb-03
<ul>
<li>Made some improvements to the GPIBLIB wrapper to
support instruments like the HP5345 and HP5370 counters that use
terminator characters to delimit transmitted strings. 
<li>Added example
"get current frequency" programs for these counters in their respective
subdirectories.
<li>Sending a GPIB device-clear message is now optional behavior for
GPIB_startup(), and disabled by default. This change was needed to 
avoid resetting the HP5370B counter during GPIB handshaking. It 
doesn't seem to have affected any other instruments.
</ul>
Release 1.00 of 15-Apr-03
<ul>
<li>Beta release of the new and improved 7470.EXE: near-complete rewrite.  
<li>All commands accessible via Windows menu

<li>New "wait for plot" feature should (theoretically) support any 
instrument in talk-only mode
<li>Many UI improvements including resolution switching and overlay/browse modes
</ul>
Release 1.50 of 19-Jul-04
<ul>
<li>Many improvements, including more supported

</ul>

Release 1.94 of 5-Feb-07
<ul>
<li>Enabled EOS termination in device-initiated plot mode on NI cards.  This shouldn't cause problems for anyone but
if it does, please <a href="mailto:john@miles.io">let me know</a>.
</ul>

Release 1.95 of 6-Feb-07
<ul>
<li>Changed 7470.INI file entry async_GPIB_timeout to async_GPIB_timeout_ms.  All applications that call GPIB_connect() now 
specify their timeout parameters directly in milliseconds, rather than using the GPTIMEOUT type.  As with the 1.94
update above, this change should not affect most users of the GPIB Toolkit
</ul>

Release 1.96 of 8-Feb-07
<ul>
<li>7470.exe no longer enables board-level EOS termination during device-initiated plots, due to problems 
reported with certain instruments (e.g., Wiltron 562).  (Board-level EOS checks were originally added for 
the benefit of the <b>listen.exe</b> command-line utility, but they're not useful in 7470.exe.)
</ul>

Release 1.97 of 4-Mar-07
<ul>
<li>The use of instrument-menu shortcuts in the 7470.INI file no longer disables the "Request plot from 
supported device at address xx" options in the <i>Acquire</i> menu

values in 7470.INI to avoid clipping problems
<li>Removed <i>Display->Aspect correction</i> menu options, which are no longer needed
<li>The last version of the GPIB Toolkit with the original HP-GL renderer can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.ke5fx.com/gpib/setup148.exe">http://www.ke5fx.com/gpib/setup148.exe</a>
</ul>
<li>The <i>Acquire</i> and <i>GPIB</i> menus now work exactly the same way with Prologix and National Instruments adapters
<ul>
<li>Removed <b>controller_mode</b>, <b>device_addressable</b>, and <b>host_addressable</b> fields from CONNECT.INI, replacing them with <b>is_Prologix</b>
<li>If <b>is_Prologix</b> is nonzero, the Prologix adapter is assumed to 
be capable of software-based mode and address configuration
<li>Users of other interfaces, as well as early Prologix adapters that don't support programmable addressing, will need to edit CONNECT.INI manually to set <b>is_Prologix</b> to 0
</ul>
<li>Captions from all loaded files are visible in Overlay mode
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed bug affecting XT and YT tick mark placement (Tek 2430A/2432A/2440 graticules)
</ul>

Release 1.9985 of 9-Jun-11
<ul>
<li>Plots from HP 8753 series analyzers should now be requested with the F9 shortcut (Acquire->HP 8510 or 8753 series).  The previous shortcut, F11, was yielding incomplete or misaligned plots on some instruments.
<li>HP-GL label text in Browse mode is now rendered in the selected pen color, rather than black.  As before, user captions are rendered in black in Browse mode, and all text drawn in Overlay mode is based on the order in which each plot was loaded or acquired. 
<li>Bumped the default x_margin and y_margin values in 7470.INI from 16 to 24 pixels to avoid excessive clipping on some plots
</ul>

Release 1.9986 of 28-May-12

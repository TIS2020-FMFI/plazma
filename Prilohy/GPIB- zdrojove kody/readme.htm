<a name=prologix><h2>GPIB CONFIGURATOR</h2></a>
<P>
PROLOGIX.EXE allows you to select and configure a Prologix GPIB-USB or GPIB-ETHERNET adapter for use with the GPIB Toolkit applications.  It can also be used to select 
a National Instruments adapter, or to configure the GPIB Toolkit to work with an otherwise-unsupported TCP/IP or serial adapter.
<P>
<img src="./prologix.gif" align=right hspace=20>
Most of the GPIB Toolkit applications support both Prologix and National Instruments GPIB adapters.  By default, the Toolkit expects to find a National Instruments device 
at GPIB0.  When using a Prologix adapter, it's necessary to edit the CONNECT.INI file to tell the GPIB Toolkit where to find the Prologix adapter's 
virtual serial port or network address.
<P>
This task is easy to accomplish with PROLOGIX.EXE.  Simply run the program, select the Prologix or National Instruments adapter in the device list, and press the
<b>Update CONNECT.INI</b> button.  (Be sure to exit from PROLOGIX.EXE before attempting to run any other GPIB Toolkit application.)
<P>
You can use the <b>Edit CONNECT.INI</b> button in PROLOGIX.EXE as a convenient way to modify your existing GPIB configuration manually, regardless of whether
or not you're using a Prologix adapter.  Editing the file also gives you access to additional options for troubleshooting and optimization.  See the 
comments in CONNECT.INI for more information.
<P>
Beginning with the V1.50 release of the GPIB Toolkit, it is no longer necessary to select Device or Controller mode in PROLOGIX.EXE unless you wish to use the optional Terminal 
or Advanced Settings controls.  Each Toolkit application will configure the Prologix adapter's 
mode and address settings as needed. 
<P>
<br>
<pre>
           Usage examples:
           
           prologix                 Run with no command-line options for normal enumeration of all 
                                    Prologix GPIB-USB, GPIB-ETHERNET, and National Instruments adapters

           prologix -noni           Don't attempt to enumerate National Instruments adapters (useful if
                                    error messages are reported after a partial NI488.2 driver uninstallation)

           prologix -nonet          Don't issue UDP broadcasts to detect Prologix GPIB-ETHERNET adapters

<a name=console><h2>SATRACE</h2></a>
<P>

<b>SATRACE.EXE</b> can be thought of as a console-oriented version of <a href="./ssm.htm">SSM</a>.  It requests one or more traces from any spectrum analyzer supported by SSM,
and writes them to stdout as lists of comma-separated frequency/amplitude pairs.

           satrace 18 -disconnect:"xxx" 
                                    Specify GPIB command string to be issued when

           satrace 18 -856xa -f     Example using multiple options
</pre>
Like SSM, SATRACE does not normally attempt to control or configure the spectrum analyzer.  Traces are acquired based on the current
front-panel settings such as center frequency, reference level, resolution bandwidth, and so forth.  However, SATRACE does provide 
limited control options for certain analyzer models.  These options are shown below.
<pre>
           Additional control options supported by Signal Hound only:
           
                -RL:-40             Specify reference level in dBm (default = -30)
                -CF:90.3E6          Specify center frequency in Hz (default = 900 MHz)
                -span:10E6          Specify span in Hz (default = 1 MHz)
                -start:88E6         Specify sweep start frequency (default = 899 MHz)
                -stop:108E6         Specify sweep stop frequency (default = 901 MHz)
                -bins:64            Specify FFT kernel size (power of 2 from 16 to 256,
                                    default = 128)
                -sens:2             Specify sensitivity factor (default = 2, range 0-2)
                -RFATT:10           Specify RF attenuation in dB (0-15 dB in 5-dB steps,
                                    default = 0)
</pre>
In most cases, SATRACE's output will be "piped" to another file or application.  For example, the command
<pre>
           <font color=RED><b>c:\program files\ke5fx\gpib></b></font>satrace 18 -reps:100 -point:500 >temp.txt
</pre>
will read 100 successive traces from the analyzer at GPIB address 18, point-sample them to generate
500 (Hz,dBm) value pairs for each trace, and write the resulting comma-separated value lists to the file <b>temp.txt</b>.

<P>

<a name=sgentest><h2>SGENTEST</h2></a>
<P>

<b>SGENTEST.EXE</b> tests HP signal generators (8656A/B, 8757A-D, 8642B/M,
8662A/8663A, 8672A and others) by programming randomly-chosen frequency
and amplitude settings.  Output signals are then verified by an
HP 8566A/B, 8568A/B, or 8560A/E-series spectrum analyzer.

<pre>
Usage: sgentest &lt;analyzer address&gt; &lt;generator address&gt; [&lt;options&gt; ...]

Available options (with default or example values):

         -fmax:1.2E9   .... Maximum test frequency = 1200 MHz
         -fmin:10E3    .... Minimum test frequency = 10 kHz
         -amin:-90     .... Minimum test power = -90 dBm
         -amax:10      .... Maximum test power = 10 dBm
         -loss:1.0     .... Interconnect loss in dB at fmax
         -ftol:200     .... Frequency tolerance = +/- 200 Hz
         -atol:2       .... Amplitude tolerance = +/- 2 dBm
         -wait:0.25    .... Wait 250 milliseconds after programming generator
         -8662         .... Check for HP 8662A/8663A hardware errors
         -8672         .... Compatibility mode for HP 8672A signal generators
         -8560         .... Compatibility mode for certain HP 8560A/B/E portable analyzers
         -log:filename .... Log output to filename
         -trials:1000  .... Stop after 1000 trials
         -verbose      .... Display/log all trials, not just failures
         -srand:500    .... Seed random # generator with integer
         -stime        .... Seed random # generator with time() function

Notes:

- Minimum test power must be sufficient to yield good amplitude measurements
- Numeric arguments are reals, and may use scientific notation
- 8662A/8663A hardware error checks are disabled by default
- Some 8560A/B/E-series portables may require -8560 switch for compatibility
  (which inhibits use of KSX and KSb commands for amplitude correction and
  positive-peak detection)
- Test will run indefinitely if -trials is 0 (or not specified)
- Default -loss value is based on 15 feet of LMR-400 and two N connectors at fmax=1.2E9
- When using the -8672 option, set the front panel RANGE control to minimum power (-110 dBm) to avoid false readings

Example to test HP 8663A at address 19 with analyzer at address 18, using 15 feet of LMR-400 cable (1.0 dB loss) with N connectors (0.15 dB each):

<a name=console><h2>Miscellaneous Win32 Console Applications</h2></a>
<P>
By default, the following utilities are installed with the rest of the GPIB Toolkit executables in the installation directory, normally <font color=RED><b>C:\Program Files\KE5FX\GPIB</b></font> or <font color=RED><b>C:\Program Files (x86)\KE5FX\GPIB</b></font>.  In most cases you can obtain usage notes by running
each program with no command-line arguments.
<P>
<b>PARSE.EXE</b> is a simple command-line utility that allows you to inspect HP-GL files by dumping their instructions to stdout.
<P>
<b>QUERY.EXE</b> is a standalone GPIB query utility intended for diagnostic purposes and batch/shortcut files.
<P>
<b>TALK.EXE</b> is a standalone GPIB command-transmission utility intended for diagnostic purposes and batch/shortcut files.
<P>
<b>LISTEN.EXE</b> is a standalone GPIB data-reception utility for ASCII traffic, intended for diagnostic purposes and batch/shortcut files.
<P>
<b>BINQUERY.EXE</b> is a standalone GPIB query utility intended for diagnostic purposes and batch/shortcut files.  It illustrates
how to retrieve arbitrarily-large binary data blocks from GPIB instrumentation.
<P>
<b>PSAPLOT.EXE</b> retrieves .GIF screenshots from an Agilent PSA-series spectrum analyzer (tested on E4443A with firmware version A.11.21).  It also works with the E4406A vector signal analyzer.
<P>
<b>GPS.EXE</b> is an example program for the GNSS.DLL library.  It displays incoming latitude, longitude, and altitude fixes.  GNSS.DLL provides a C API for NMEA-compatible GPS receivers such as the u-blox <a href="http://www.u-blox.com/en/gps-modules/pvt-modules/lea-6-family.html">LEA-6</a> series.
<P>
<b>5071A.EXE</b> sets the clock on an HP 5071A / Symmetricom 5071A primary frequency standard from a specified NTP server.
<P>
<b>5345A.EXE</b> and <b>5370.EXE</b> are two example programs that show how to communicate via GPIB with the HP 5345A and HP 5370A/B frequency counters, respectively.  They are 
meant to be modified and recompiled as needed.
<P>
<b>8672A.EXE</b> programs the output frequency and (optionally) power level for the HP 8672A microwave signal generator.
<P>
<b>DTS2070.EXE</b> demonstrates capture of timing data from a Wavecrest DTS2070 timing analyzer.  Like the HP counter 
utilities it is meant to be modified as needed.
<P>
<b>ATTEN_3488A.EXE</b> demonstrates remote control of RF step attenuators via a HP 3488A / HP 44170A programmable switch.
<P>
<b>T962.EXE</b> reads data from a Puhui T962-series oven with ESTechnical firmware. (experimental)
<P>
<b>DSO6000.EXE</b> retrieves voltage data from a trace captured on an Agilent DSO/MSO6000A-series oscilloscope.  If an output filename is supplied on 
the command line, the data will be written as a series of double-precision binary values; otherwise, the voltage values will be printed to stdout.
DSO6000.EXE assumes that a SINGLE sweep has run to completion, and that the oscilloscope is in STOP mode (STOP/RUN button illuminated red.)
It was tested on an MSO6054A, and may or may not be compatible with other Agilent models such as the DSO/MSO5000A series.
<P>
<b>CAL_TEK490.EXE</b> contains various calibration aids from the Tektronix 492P service manual.  Run the program for a menu of 
available calibration routines.
<P>
<b>DATAQ.EXE</b> acquires data from a DataQ DI-154RS or DI-194 serial DAQ adapter.
<P>
<b>SSMDUMP.EXE</b> shows how to access the row data from an .SSM file.
<P>
<b>ECHOCLIENT.EXE</b> and <b>ECHOSERVER.EXE</b> are intended for troubleshooting and benchmarking TCP/IP connections.  These utilities communicate over port 4242.  (Note that
benchmark results obtained from these programs are normally limited by the GPIB Toolkit's network layer, rather than by the connection itself.)
<P>
<b>PRINTHPG.EXE</b> sends a plotter data file (.PLT, .HPG, etc.) to the default DOS printer (PRN device). This printer should 
be an HP LaserJet or compatible model that supports legacy HP-GL commands. Other printers can be used by 7470.EXE, but 
the bitmaps printed by 7470.EXE will lack the resolution and fidelity obtainable by sending the plotter file directly 
to a genuine HP-GL-compatible printer. 
<P>
If you have a LaserJet and want the best-quality black-and-white output possible, PRINTHPG.EXE is the way to go.  
Note that even LaserJets don't support some HP-GL features, like UC (User Character) opcodes! If your instrument relies on these, you'll need to use 7470.EXE to render its plots and print them as fixed-resolution bitmaps.
<P>
<b>TCPLIST.EXE</b> transmits a string to a specified TCP/IP address and listens for a reply.  Command-line options specify the timeout interval, EOS character, and the number of ASCII text lines
expected in response.  TCPLIST.EXE is handy for accessing instruments that support Telnet connections or other simple ASCII-based protocols.
<P>
<b>NTPQUERY.EXE</b> requests the current time from a specified NTP server (e.g., <i>ntpquery pool.ntp.org</i>).  
<P>
<b>VISADMM.EXE</b> acquires data from an HP 34461A or similar VISA-capable DMM.  
<P>
<b>11848A.EXE</b> is an experimental program for direct control of an HP 11848A Phase Noise Interface from the 3048A system.  

<hr>

<a name=batch><h2>Example Batch Files for Instrument Control</h2></a>
<P>
By default, the following batch files are installed with the rest of the GPIB Toolkit executables in the installation directory.  They may be
inspected and modified with any word processor or text editor capable of working with plaintext ASCII files.
<P>
<b>WIFI_HP8566.BAT</b> uses TALK.EXE to program an HP 8566B spectrum analyzer at GPIB address 18 for 2350-2550 MHz sweeps at 5 dB/division, selecting a -35 dBm reference level and 0 dB of RF 
attenuation.  It then launches SSM.EXE with max-accumulation and WiFi band boundaries enabled.
<P>
<b>WIFI_TEK490.BAT</b> uses TALK.EXE to program a Tektronix 492P/494P/494AP/497P analyzer at GPIB address 3 in a similar fashion.  The
analyzer's CRT readout is turned off to prevent burn-in.
<P>
<b>WIFI_E4406A.BAT</b> programs an Agilent E4406A Vector Signal Analyzer at GPIB address 18 to display the middle 10 MHz of WiFi channel 1 (2412 MHz).
It then launches SSM.EXE with max-accumulation and WiFi band boundaries enabled.
<P>
<b>GPS_SA44.BAT</b> programs a Signal Hound USB-SA44/B or USB-SA124A spectrum analyzer to display the middle 6 MHz of the GPS L1 band at 1575.42 MHz.
It then launches SSM.EXE with max-accumulation and GPS band boundaries enabled.
<P>
<b>R3267.BAT</b> uses BINQUERY.EXE to request .BMP images from an Advantest R3264, R3267, or R3273 spectrum 
analyzer at GPIB address 7.
<P>
<b>TDSBMP.BAT</b> uses BINQUERY.EXE to request color .BMP images from a Tektronix TDS-series oscilloscope.  This should work with most TDS models (tested on TDS 694C).
<P>
<b>IMD_8566B_8568B.BAT</b> uses TALK.EXE to transmit the downloadable program (DLP) T_HIRDIMOD to the nonvolatile user RAM on 
an HP 8566B or 8568B spectrum analyzer.  This program performs basic third-order intermodulation distortion 
measurements on signals between 10 MHz and 500 MHz, and also calculates IP3.  See HP product note 8566B/8568B-1 for more information.
<P>
<b>ESM.BAT</b> uses TALK.EXE to control a Rohde & Schwarz ESM-500A receiver.  Run the batch file without any arguments to see a brief
usage guide.
<P>
<b>TSCCMD.BAT</b> uses TCPLIST.EXE to control a Symmetricom TSC 5115A/5120A/5125A phase noise test set.  Run the batch file without any arguments to see a brief 
usage guide.
<P>
<b>TCP2PNP.BAT</b> uses TCPLIST.EXE to save the phase noise spectrum from a Symmetricom TSC 5115A/5120A/5125A as a .PNP file 
compatible with the PN.EXE phase noise utility.
<P>
<b>SET5071A.BAT</b> uses 5071A.EXE to set the clock on the HP 5071A at the specified COM port to the current NTP time obtained from pool.ntp.org.
